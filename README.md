# RoyaleFTop
An asynchronously-focused and comprehensive leaderboard created using the Spigot Java API.

## Description
RoyaleFactionsTop is a 'faction' worth aggregator for the popular minecraft plugin 'FactionsUUID'.  It was created to replace popular factionstop plugins from the SpigotMC website.  This product has been fully optimized to handle even the largest calculations (6.5536 Ã— 108 concurrent blocks = 10,000 chunks).  Most parts of the calculation are processed asyncronously, with only non-thred-safe methods used on the main thread.  This plugin is also 100% configurable through the config.yml file provided in the resources folder.

## Installation
To install the product, please clone this repository, then run the maven install command.  You can compile the product using ___mvn package__.

## API
Coming soon.
